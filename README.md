## Description

This is a repository to share code and data for analysis of landscape genetics for Golden Lion Tamarins (_Leontopithecus rosalia_) in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil. The data refers to molecular data on 201 individuals, from native, translocated, reintroduced (and unknown) groups, that live within and around the São João river watershed, in the Rio de Janeiro State.

There are two files (inside the folder [Data](https://github.com/LEEClab/Landscape_genetics_GoldenLionTamarins/tree/master/Data)) and two scripts for analyses (inside the folder [Code](https://github.com/LEEClab/Landscape_genetics_GoldenLionTamarins/tree/master/Code)).
The data refer to:

- [Moraes_etal_data_landscape_genetics_Leontopithecus_rosalia.csv](https://github.com/LEEClab/Landscape_genetics_GoldenLionTamarins/blob/master/Data/Moraes_etal_data_landscape_genetics_Leontopithecus_rosalia.csv): Pairwise kinship between pairs of individuals (i,j), information about each individual, and landscape variables related to ecological corridors linking the position of these pairs of individuals.
- [Distance_between_shared_alleles.csv](https://github.com/LEEClab/Landscape_genetics_GoldenLionTamarins/blob/master/Data/Distance_between_shared_alleles.csv): Data on the frequency and position of each location where an individual presented a given allele from a given locus. Locations are presented for both historical (1990's) and recent (around 2010) survey, and the Euclidean and Resistance-based distances were calculated between the nearest historical and recent point of occurence of each allele.

Individual locations were modified (maintaining the spatial arrangement) for conservation purposes, but may be shared under request.

A METADATA file may be found with data, describing the data and the columns in each file.
